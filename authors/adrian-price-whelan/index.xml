      <description>Our group meeting is structured such that group members add slides to a shared Google slide deck with various sections and then we go through the deck as a group. One of these sections is called &amp;ldquo;feelings&amp;rdquo; and this week most of our slides were in that section. So, instead of our usual blog post, here&amp;rsquo;s a very accurate summary of our group meeting slides with &amp;lt;3 to XKCD.

      <title>How to automatically retrieve a Bibtex entry for a Zenodo record (and add it to a Sphinx documentation page)</title>

      <description>Niche software trick warning!
Today I have been working on overhauling the documentation theme and content for a Python package I maintain, gala, which uses Sphinx to build the documentation. On the current main documentation page, I ask users who write papers with gala to cite the JOSS paper and the Zenodo record for the version that they use, in keeping with good software citation practices.
I want to make it as easy as possible for users to retrieve the relevent Bibtex entries for gala to include in papers, so I include the Bibtex directly on the main page of the gala documentation.</description>

      <title>Unresolved binaries and where they appear in the color-magnitude diagram</title>

      <description>David Hogg and I have been working on &amp;ldquo;open fiber&amp;rdquo; proposals for the SDSS-V surveys, which will decide targets for fibers (fiber optic cables that connect from the focal plane to the SDSS spectrographs) that are not allocated by the main survey. As a part of that, I have been making many, many color-magnitude diagrams with data from the Gaia Mission (Data Release 2; DR2). For example, look at any one of the panels in the figures above: The gray background is the same in all panels and shows the density of stars selected from Gaia DR2 in the Gaia BP-RP color and absolute G-band magnitude (these have been cleaned to remove high-RUWE sources, but if that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean anything to you&amp;hellip;ignore this comment!</description>

      <title>Stellar streams around the Milky Way in the Legacy Surveys imaging data</title>

      <description>The stellar halo of the Milky Way is full of debris streams — &amp;ldquo;stellar streams&amp;rdquo; — left over from dwarf galaxies and globular clusters that have been destroyed by our Galaxy&amp;rsquo;s gravitational field. These structures are diffuse, distant, and much lower density than foreground stars in, e.g., the Milky Way disk, which is why they don&amp;rsquo;t appear if you just plot the sky positions of all stars from a photometric survey like the SDSS or Pan-STARRS.</description>
